# Hello-World
Welcome to my github! I am Benjamin Huang, a Stony Brook University student studying computer engineering. I realized recently that I enjoy coding and wanted to dive deeper into the field and found an interest in AI which I know is a broad field so I still have to dive deeper. I mostly teach myself to code because my school's computer engineering program doesn't integrate computer science as much as I would like. 

Best,
Benjamin Huang
